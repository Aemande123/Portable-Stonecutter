# Portable Stonecutter

This just adds a stonecutter item which performs the same functions as the block.

It also features a new and improved GUI allowing you to see more recipes at once, buttons to craft a stack
or all available items and a recipe locking function allowing you to then perform the recipe without opening the GUI
by left clicking a block with the portable stonecutter.

The item is crafted inworld by dropping an anvil unto 2 redstone dusts, a stonecutter and a wooden pressure plate
all as item entities within a single block space.

Thanks to Ridanisaurus for the textures, ideas and help throughout.
